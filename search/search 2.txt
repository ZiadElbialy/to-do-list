for of
The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:
variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.

iterable - An object that has iterable properties.

for in

The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:
The for in loop iterates over a person object
Each iteration returns a key (x)
The key is used to access the value of the key
The value of the key is person[x]

while Loop
The do...while statements combo defines a code block to be executed once, and repeated as long as a condition is true.

The do...while is used when you want to run a code block at least one time.


loops

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Often this is the case when working with arrays

avaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
